Despite its ups and downs, the stock market can help investors make money over time if they make smart decisions based on past performance and market trends.
* Share Market: The share market is where investors can trade various types of securities, like shares, bonds, mutual funds, and more.

Investors can buy and sell shares whenever they want.

* Limit Order: Instead of the current market price, you specify a certain price to buy or sell a stock. It guarantees a price but not necessarily execution.

* Stop Loss Order: You set a price trigger; if the stock reaches that price, it's sold. This helps prevent bigger losses if the market moves against you.

* Good-Till-Canceled (GTC): Orders valid only during the day they're placed. If not executed, they don't carry over to the next day.
